## Why are Model Extraction Attacks Dangerous?

Model extraction attacks present several security risks:

1. They can bypass the monetization of ML APIs by creating a local copy of the model
2. They might expose proprietary model architectures and training techniques
3. They enable other attacks like adversarial example generation

## Our Recent Research

In our WACV 2024 paper, we introduced a novel approach to enhance model extraction attacks using ensemble-based sample selection. The key insight is that by carefully selecting which inputs to query, we can extract more accurate models with fewer queries.

### The Ensemble Approach

Our method uses an ensemble of substitute models to identify the most informative query points. Here's how it works:

1. Train multiple substitute models with different architectures
2. Use disagreement between ensemble members to select query points
3. Actively learn from the target model's responses

## Defending Against Model Extraction

While perfect defense against model extraction might be impossible, several approaches can help:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Restrict the number of queries from each user
2. **Output Perturbation**: Add controlled noise to model predictions
3. **Watermarking**: Embed verifiable signatures in model behavior

## Future Directions

Our research suggests several promising directions for future work:

1. Developing more robust defensive techniques
2. Understanding the theoretical limits of model extraction
3. Exploring the connection between extraction and privacy

## Conclusion

Model extraction remains a significant challenge in ML security. Through our research, we're working to better understand these attacks and develop effective defenses. Stay tuned for more updates on our ongoing work in this area.
